Four key points to remember about Klarna.

1.

Klarna services are
here to accelerate
commerce ina
long-term and
sustainable way that
is good for consumers
and retailers alike.

2.

Klarna is much more
than just BNPL and
online.

e Klarna is all payments
(Pay now is ~40%)

e Klarna is available through
all channels (card, browser
and in-store)

e Klarna has an additional
third revenue stream
(marketing opportunity is
big and growing)

3.

Klarna is profitable at
its core with a healthy
and sustainable
business model.

e Gross margins in core

markets are high

Maturity of market and
proportion of new customers
are the main drivers of unit
economics

If you can get comfortable
with the outlook for losses in
the US, then our long-term
case is done

4.

Klarna is growing fast
and has many levers
to grow even faster.

e@ Revenue from adoption of
current products by existing
merchants and consumers

e New commerce solutions to
generate marketing
revenue, and this isn't just
an idea, these are in motion
with real revenues and are
growing fast

e Our addressable market is
close to unlimited

K.

Currently these markets generate USD 79 m in gross profit per month after additional local costs they contribute USD 51m
. We estimate revenue to grow 13% for established markets, much slower than the CAGR for last years.

e In autumn 2021 we introduce Pink Standards, and removed consumer fees of USD 100 m per year. This in combination with lower year on year growth rates due to COVID was the main
reason for the much lower than CAGR estimates.

. Shift in focus on established markets towards cost control and revenue per customer, will drive more growth and also return our gross margin to 73% vs current 68%.
In addition we expect smaller improvements in customer service costs at around USD 1.2 m per month.

By July 2023 we expect an improvement to gross profit by USD 15.8 m and including customer service USD 17m per month

From pe esate to positive gross margin improves EBT by USD 27 m per
