Klarna Bank AB Group - Financial update January - September 2020
Summary of the period, January 1- September 30, 2020
All numbers relate to the period January 1 - September 30 2020 if not otherwise stated.
Business highlights from the period:

e The accelerated shift towards e-commerce globally continues and our offering resonates well with consumers
and retailers. We are providing a smarter, healthier and simpler alternative to credit cards, and the rapidly
increasing demand drives volume growth. Gross merchandise volume’ increased by 43% YoY and amounts to
SEK 330bn (USD 35bn’). Total net operating income increased by 37% YoY and amounted to SEK 7bn (USD
742m). As new retailers are onboarded and current ones increase their focus on e-commerce in line with
consumer demand, we have seen a 58% increase in Merchant revenue and overall increase of 42% YoY in
Commission income, amounting to SEK 5.2bn (USD 558m). During the quarter, Klarna has increasingly diversified
revenue streams with new non-credit and affiliate services.

e While gross merchandise volume continued to see strong growth during the period, net credit losses improved
for the second consecutive quarter, decreasing by 28% compared to Q3 2019. The improved credit behavior is
especially driven by the US market, and results from consistent focus to strengthen the credit portfolio, taking
both new and returning consumers into account. In the context of the current macroenvironment, we maintain
the reserve of SEK 127m (USD 14m) as market conditions remain uncertain in light of Covid-19 and related
effects.

e During the period close to 21 million new consumers used our services across all markets. We see particularly
strong growth in the US where the number of consumers have grown by 230% compared to the same period last
year. Most importantly our consumer base is highly engaged and loyal, and we continue to see that existing
consumers transact even more frequently.

e More consumers have discovered the benefits of using the shopping browser, i.e. the direct to consumer
offering in the Klarna app that enables them to shop at any of their preferred retailers. The Klarna app is a
one-stop shopping destination that covers the whole journey, from browsing and finding the best deals, to
purchasing items from any online retailer, paying with our flexible alternatives and delivery tracking. The direct
to consumer offering has expanded to new markets and sees immediate traction, with 160% YoY growth in
global app downloads, and close to 13 million monthly active app users by period end, reaching 14 million by end
of October. Consumers are increasingly engaging with the different app features such as wish lists, as they plan
for what to shop. At period end, close to 3.5 million items had been added to wish lists.

e Global brands and retailers continue to choose Klarna as their preferred payment provider and onboarding has
accelerated ahead of the busiest shopping season. Our elevated shopping experience drives millions of
referrals and traffic each month from owned channels to our retailers as consumers are actively seeking out
retailers where they can shop with Klarna. During the period more than 57,000 retailers have been added to the
global base of more than 200,000 retail partners.

o New and existing retailers include: Macy's, Etsy, Sephora, H&M, Express, ASOS, The North Face, Finish
Line, TaylorMade, Abercrombie & Fitch, Beautycounter, Vans, Farfetch, FWRD, Gymshark, Samsung,
Fender, NTWRK, Timberland, Beauty Bay, Ralph Lauren and Acne Studios.

e The popularity of Klarna’s offering in the US is growing rapidly and the number of consumers that have used our
services amounted to more than 10 million by the end of September. The accelerated consumer acquisition
continued after period end and amounted to more than 11 million by the end of October. The Klarna app in the
US had 1.7 million monthly active users by the end of the period reaching 2 million by the end of October. In
September we reached a new all time high in monthly shopping volume. The Klarna app made up 64% of all pay
later app downloads during the month of September? and took the number one spot among the most
downloaded shopping apps in the US App Store ahead of giants like Amazon, Walmart and Target. This growth
has continued, and the app is by November averaging 50,000 new daily downloads, three times more than

nearest direct competitors. Klarna’s loyalty program, Vibe, which rewards consumers who pay their goods on
time has grown quickly. We saw great traction already in beta stage during summer with more than 500 users
enrolling per week from a limited user base. After full launch at the beginning of September, 350,000
consumers have joined, and earlier in November we reached the half million mark. The program has recently
been rolled out in Australia and other markets will follow.

Despite the accelerated shift to online we have seen strong volume growth of 174% through the Klarna card. Its
flexible, smart and rewarding features includes no fees, no added FX cost, instant purchase notifications and
the possibility to pay with your phone. This feature provides a safer way to pay as consumers don't have to
touch any devices. We are also seeing how Germans to a larger extent are turning from cash to card, with
September being a record month with almost 30,000 cards issued to new users in Germany and Sweden
combined. By the end of October, the total number of issued cards reached 500,000.

We have expanded our banking offering by launching our own savings accounts in Sweden in July. Our accounts
offer consumers competitive rates, and we have seen immediate traction with more than 20,000 new
consumers at period end. We have also partnered with Raisin, a deposit market place, to further strengthen our
presence in the German deposit market. The Klarna savings account is the first step in building an integrated
banking experience for our consumers.

Total expenses were in line with plan. We remain committed to further investing in expanding and enhancing our
consumer-friendly product offering as well as in top talent and increased brand awareness, with a focus on the
US and market expansion. This year alone we have launched in four new markets: Australia in partnership with
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Belgium, Spain and Italy.

We continue to very actively manage down the share of late fees in relation to total volume during the period.
This is to a large extent supported by increased app usage adoption as the app helps consumers keep track of
their outstanding payments, enabling them to increase control over their personal finances.

Events during the period:

In September, we announced that we raised USD 650m in an equity funding round at a post money valuation of
USD 10.65bn, which ranks Klarna as the highest-valued private fintech in Europe and now the 4th highest
worldwide. The funding round provides a robust financial position, which will support our further investment in
our unique shopping offering, continue to grow our global presence, and accelerate our strong momentum
across all markets, especially in the US. The funding round was led by Silver Lake, the global leader in
technology investing, alongside GIC - Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund - as well as funds and accounts
managed by BlackRock and HMI Capital. Concurrently, Merian Chrysalis, TCV, Northzone and Bonnier have
acquired shares from existing shareholders.
